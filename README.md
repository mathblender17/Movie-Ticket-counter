# Movie-Ticket-counter-implementation

A Project to apply and  implement  concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.

to design and implement a queue data structure that efficiently manages and processes movie ticket bookings in a first-come, first-served (FCFS) manner. 

The FCFS queue is essential for ensuring fair and orderly processing of booking requests at a movie ticket counter. 

The queue should adhere to the FCFS principle, where the first customer to arrive is the first to be served, creating a fair and orderly queue for ticket reservations.

## Excepted outcome :

The expected outcome of this problem is to have a well-designed and efficiently implemented FCFS queue data structure that serves as a core component of a movie ticket booking system. 
This queue should maintain the order of booking requests and provide a fair and orderly ticket booking process for customers.
The system should be capable of handling concurrent access and provide error handling for various scenarios.
This FCFS queue, when integrated into a larger movie ticket booking system, will help ensure that customers are served in the order they arrive, creating a fair and efficient ticket bookingÂ experience
